<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Create project

    Run the `create next-app` command to create a new Next.js project.

    ```package-install
    npm create next-app --ts --tailwind
    ```

    Walk through the prompts and choose the options you want.

    ```text
    What is your project named? › my-app
    Would you like to use ESLint? › Yes
    Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? › Yes
    Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) › Yes
    Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`? › Yes
    Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? › Yes
    What import alias would you like configured? › ~/*
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Run the CLI

    Run the `@kosori/cli init` command to configure the project.

    ```package-install
    npx @kosori/cli init
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### That's it!

    You can now start adding components or hooks to your project.

    ```package-install
    npx @kosori/cli add components button
    ```

    The command will install the `Button` component to your project. And you can import it in your code.

    ```tsx
    import { Button } from '~/components/ui/button'; // [!code highlight]

    export const Home = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          {/* [!code highlight:1] */}
          <Button>Click me</Button>
        </div>
      )
    }

    export default Home;
    ```

  </Step>
  
</Steps>
