<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Create project

    Run the `create next-app` command to create a new Next.js project.

    ```package-install
    npm create gatsby -ts
    ```

    Walk through the prompts and choose the options you want.

    ```text
    What would you like to call your site? › my-app
    What would you like to name the folder where your site will be created? › my-ap
    Will you be using a CMS? › Choose whatever you want
    Would you like to install a styling system? › Tailwind CSS
    Would you like to install additional features with other plugins? › Choose whatever you want
    Shall we do this? › Yes
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Update `tsconfig.json`

    Add the `baseUrl` and `paths` properties to the `compilerOptions` section of the `tsconfig.json` file:

    ```json
    {
      /* ... */
      "compilerOptions": {
        /* [!code highlight:4] */
        "baseUrl": ".",
        "paths": {
          "~/*": ["./src/*"]
        }
      }
      /* ... */
    }
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Create `gatsby-node.ts`

    ```ts
    import * as path from "path";

    export const onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ actions }) => {
      actions.setWebpackConfig({
        resolve: {
          alias: {
            "~/components": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/components"),
            "~/lib/utils": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/lib/utils"),
          },
        },
      });
    };
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Create project

    Run the `@kosori/cli init` command to configure the project.

    ```package-install
    npx @kosori/cli init
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### That's it!

    You can now start adding components or hooks to your project.

    ```package-install
    npx @kosori/cli add components button
    ```

    The command will install the `Button` component to your project. And you can import it in your code.

    ```tsx
    import { Button } from '~/components/ui/button'; // [!code highlight]

    export const Home = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          {/* [!code highlight:1] */}
          <Button>Click me</Button>
        </div>
      )
    }

    export default Home;
    ```

  </Step>
  
</Steps>
