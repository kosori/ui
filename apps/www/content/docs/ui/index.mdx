## What is Kõsori UI?

Kõsori UI is a collection of copy-paste components with [tsdoc](https://tsdoc.org) inspired by [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com).
I created it because I wanted to create something similar for myself using my style and the tools that I'm familiar with to challenge myself.

Shadcn UI is an amazing project. I have been using it for almost two years now. I love it.
This is not a replace for Shadcn UI or any other copy-paste UI library.
This is for personal use, but if you want to use it, you can do so. I will appreciate if you do and help me to improve it.

<Callout type='warn' title='Work in progress'>

## FAQ

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title='Whats the difference from Shadcn UI?'>
    Kõsori UI is similar to Shadcn UI. Use [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)
    primive components and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
    Although Kõsori UI uses other dependencies, like:
    - [Radix UI Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) instead of [Tailwind Colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors).
    - [Tailwind Variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/) instead of [CVA](https://cva.style).
    - Use [tsdoc](https://tsdoc.org) to give a little bit of context to the components.

<Accordion title='Can I use Kõsori UI in my project?'>
  Kõsori UI is not production-ready. But you can use it in your side projects to
  experiment. Let me know if you do. Share with me what you built.
</Accordion>

{' '}

<Accordion title='Kõsori UI is open source?'>
  Yes. Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kosori/ui) and the
  [license](https://github.com/kosori/ui/blob/main/LICENSE).
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Why tsdoc?'>
    As developers, when we are working with different tools, it is impossible to remember all about a tool in particular.
    In Kõsori UI, I use [tsdoc](https://tsdoc.org) to prevent myself from getting distracted going to the documentation and then returning to the code.
    
    Although there are some components, this may be useless. Let me know what you think.
