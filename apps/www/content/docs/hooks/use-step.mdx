## Details

### Step Navigation

- The `useStep` hook provides a straightforward way to manage multi-step navigation in applications, such as wizards or forms. It allows users to move between steps easily while enforcing boundaries based on the maximum step defined.
- The hook ensures that users cannot navigate beyond the defined steps, preventing errors and enhancing user experience.

### State Management

- **`currentStep`**: A state variable that holds the current step number, initialized to `1`. This allows components to easily access the current step and render appropriate content based on it.
- **`canGoToNextStep`**: A boolean that indicates whether the user can proceed to the next step. This is useful for enabling or disabling navigation buttons.
- **`canGoToPrevStep`**: A boolean that indicates whether the user can go back to the previous step, providing similar functionality for backward navigation.

### Step Control Functions

- **`goToNextStep`**: A function that increments the `currentStep` by `1` if the next step is available. This function can be called directly from UI elements like buttons.
- **`goToPrevStep`**: A function that decrements the `currentStep` by `1` if the previous step exists, allowing users to navigate backward through the steps.
- **`setStep`**: A versatile function that allows setting the current step either directly with a number or by providing a function that computes the new step based on the previous one. This flexibility mimics the API of `useState`.

### Reset Functionality

- **`reset`**: A function that resets the `currentStep` back to `1`. This is particularly useful for scenarios where the user might want to restart the process or when the form is submitted successfully.

### Return Value

- The hook returns an object containing:
- **`currentStep`**: The current step number, which can be used to render step-specific content.
- **`goToNextStep`**: A function to navigate to the next step.
- **`goToPrevStep`**: A function to navigate to the previous step.
- **`canGoToNextStep`**: A boolean indicating if the next step is available.
- **`canGoToPrevStep`**: A boolean indicating if the previous step is available.
- **`setStep`**: A function to set the current step directly or via a function.
- **`reset`**: A function to reset the step to the initial state.
