## Details

### Clipboard Copying Mechanism

- The hook provides a seamless way to copy text to the clipboard using the modern `navigator.clipboard` API when available. This ensures a secure and reliable copying experience.
- If the `navigator.clipboard` API is not supported (e.g., in older browsers), the hook falls back to an old-school method using a temporary `<textarea>` element and the `document.execCommand('copy')` method.

### State Management

- **`isCopied`**: A boolean state that indicates whether the text has been successfully copied to the clipboard. This can be used to provide user feedback (e.g., showing a "Copied!" message).
- **`error`**: An optional state that captures any errors that occur during the copy operation. This allows for better error handling and user notifications.

### Timeout for Resetting State

- The hook includes a `timeoutDuration` parameter (defaulting to 1000 milliseconds) that determines how long the `isCopied` state remains `true` before resetting to `false`. This feature helps in providing temporary feedback to users after a copy action.
- The timeout can be customized by passing a different value when using the hook, allowing for flexibility based on user interface requirements.

### Return Value

- The hook returns an object containing:
- **`isCopied`**: A boolean indicating whether the text has been copied successfully.
- **`copyToClipboard`**: A function that takes a string as an argument and attempts to copy it to the clipboard. It returns a promise that resolves to a boolean indicating the success of the operation.
- **`error`**: An optional error object that can be used to handle any errors that occur during the copy operation.
